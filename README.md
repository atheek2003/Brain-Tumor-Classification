# Brain Tumor Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This repository contains an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying brain tumors into four categories: no tumor, meningioma tumor, glioma tumor, and pituitary tumor. The model is trained using machine learning techniques on a dataset of brain MRI images.

## Introduction

Detecting and classifying brain tumors from medical images is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment planning. This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to automatically classify brain MRI scans into different tumor categories, aiding healthcare professionals in accurate diagnosis.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation comprises MRI images of the brain, annotated with labels indicating the presence of no tumor, meningioma tumor, glioma tumor, or pituitary tumor. The dataset is obtained from [provide source or link if applicable].

## Model Architecture

The CNN architecture used for this task is designed to extract relevant features from brain MRI images and classify them into one of the four tumor categories. The model architecture includes convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, followed by softmax activation for multi-class classification.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- [Add any additional dependencies]

## Usage

To train the model, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Prepare your dataset and organize it according to the directory structure specified in the code.
4. Adjust hyperparameters, model architecture, or dataset augmentation techniques for better performance if necessary.
